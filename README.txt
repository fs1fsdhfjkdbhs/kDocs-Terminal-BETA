Hello and thank you for downloading kDocs! To use this program, you have to first run wait.py so we can
connect to your files, so we can configure and have access to all your files for you to run your commands!
To have access to the main file, after you run wait.py make sure you open app.py, if you didn't do that,
then we will need your password! Once again, thank you for downloading kDocs! Cheers.

                                        ---DISCLAMER!!---                                                 

This command line/terminal-like app is for utilities like making the computer say/do something,
DO NOT USE IT TO HACK AS THE APP WILL BE DESTROYED AND ECRYPTED!!


                                        ---NOTICE!!!!---                                                  

If you can code yourself, you can edit the scripts for yourself to make commands as this is the beta/testing
files, we are not done yet!


Thank you for your attention,
